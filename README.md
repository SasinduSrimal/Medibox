Medibox Simulation: IoT-based Medication Reminder System
An IoT-based medication reminder system designed with ESP32, Wokwi, and Node-RED. This project enables users to set medication alarms, monitor environmental conditions, and automate light control based on ambient light levels.

Key Features
   1. Customizable Alarms: Set and manage reminders across time zones.
   2. Environmental Monitoring: Uses LDR sensors for light intensity and NTP for accurate timekeeping.
   3.Dynamic Light Control: Automated lighting adjustments via Servo Motor, configurable through Node-RED.
This system demonstrates the use of IoT to improve medication adherence and user convenience.
